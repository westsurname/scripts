2. Configure the torrent blackhole download client as follows:
   - **Name**: `blackhole`
   - **Enable**: Yes
   - **Torrent Folder**: Set to `[BLACKHOLE_BASE_WATCH_PATH]/[BLACKHOLE_RADARR_PATH]` for Radarr or `[BLACKHOLE_BASE_WATCH_PATH]/[BLACKHOLE_SONARR_PATH]` for Sonarr
   - **Watch Folder**: Set to `[Torrent Folder]/completed`
   - **Save Magnet Files**: Yes, with the extension `.magnet`
   - **Read Only**: No
   - **Client Priority**: Prioritize as you please
   - **Tags**: Tag as you please

3. Run the `python_watcher.py` script to start monitoring the blackhole:

    ```bash
    python3 python_watcher.py
    ```

## Plex Request

### Setup

1. Ensure your Plex Media Server is properly configured and running.

2. In your `.env` file, make sure the following variables are set:
   - `PLEX_SERVER_PATH`: Points to your 'Plex Media Server' directory containing the certificate
   - `PLEX_SERVER_MACHINE_ID`: Your Plex server's machine identifier
   - Other required variables as listed in the configuration section

3. Start the Plex Request services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose --profile plex_request up -d
   ```

### SSL Configuration
The service automatically handles SSL by:
- Using your Plex Media Server's certificate (cert-v2.p12) from the Cache directory
- Converting it to the required format for nginx
- Automatically detecting and handling certificate updates

No manual SSL configuration is needed as long as your Plex Media Server is properly configured.

## Repair

### Usage

The repair script can be run with the following command:

```bash
python3 repair.py
```
The script accepts the following arguments:

- `--dry-run`: Perform a dry run without making any changes.
- `--no-confirm`: Execute without confirmation prompts.
- `--repair-interval`: Optional interval in smart format (e.g., '1h2m3s') to wait between repairing each media file.
- `--run-interval`: Optional interval in smart format (e.g., '1w2d3h4m5s') to run the repair process.
- `--mode`: Choose repair mode: `symlink` or `file`. `symlink` to repair broken symlinks and `file` to repair missing files. (default: 'symlink').
- `--season-packs`: Upgrade to season-packs when a non-season-pack is found. Only applicable in symlink mode.
- `--include-unmonitored`: Include unmonitored media in the repair process.

### Warning
This script can potentially delete and re-download a large number of files. It is recommended to use the `--dry-run` flag first to see what actions the script will take.

### Example

Here's an example of how you might use this script:

```bash
python3 repair.py --mode file --repair-interval 30m --run-interval 1d --dry-run
```

In this example, the script will run in 'file' mode, waiting 30 minutes between each repair and running once a day. It will perform a dry run, printing actions without executing them.


## Import Torrent Folder

### Usage

The script can be run with the following command:

```bash
python3 import_torrent_folder.py
```

The script accepts the following arguments:

- `--directory`: Specifies a specific directory to process.
- `--custom-regex`: Allows you to specify a custom multi-season regex.
- `--dry-run`: If this flag is set, the script will print actions without executing them.
- `--no-confirm`: If this flag is set, the script will execute without asking for confirmation.
- `--radarr`: If this flag is set, the script will use the Radarr symlink directory.
- `--sonarr`: If this flag is set, the script will use the Sonarr symlink directory.
- `--symlink-directory`: Allows you to specify a custom symlink directory.

### Example
Here is an example of how you might use this script:

```bash
python3 import_torrent_folder.py --directory "Some Movie (2024)" --radarr --dry-run
```

In this example, the script will process the "Some Movie (2024)" directory using the Radarr symlink directory. It will print the actions it would take without actually executing them, because the --dry-run flag is set.


## Delete Non-Linked Folders

### Usage

The script can be run with the following command:

```bash
python3 delete_non_linked_folders.py
```

The script accepts the following arguments:

- `dst_folder`: The destination folder to check for non-linked files. This folder should encompass all folders where symbolic links may exist.
- `--src-folder`: The source folder to check for non-linked files. This is the folder that the symbolic links in the destination folder should point to.
- `--dry-run`: If this flag is provided, the script will only print the non-linked file directories without deleting them.
- `--no-confirm`: If this flag is provided, the script will delete non-linked file directories without asking for confirmation.
- `--only-delete-files`: If this flag is provided, the script will delete only the files in the non-linked directories, not the directories themselves. This is useful for Zurg where directories are automatically removed if they contain no content.

### Warning

This script can potentially delete a large number of files and directories. It is recommended to use the --dry-run flag first to see what the script will delete. Also, make sure to provide the correct source and destination folders, as the script will delete any non-linked files or directories in the destination folder that are not symbolic links to the source folder.

### Example

Here is an example of how you might use this script:

```bash
python3 delete_non_linked_folders.py /path/to/destination/folder --src-folder /path/to/source/folder --dry-run
```

In this example, the script will check the "/path/to/destination/folder" directory againts the "/path/to/source/folder" directory to find directories that are not linked to. It will print the the directories that would be deleted without actually deleting them, because the --dry-run flag is set.
